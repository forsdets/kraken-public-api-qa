- Completed Happy path for single currency validation for Book, OHLC, Spread, Ticker, Trade
- Completed Negative paths
- Schema validation completed for all happy path scenarios and all the public feeds
- Logging mechanism implemented

Remarks:

Due to time constraints I couldn't complete the below points:

- Happy path for Multiple Currency validation
- There are lots of negative scenarios in my mind based on the https://docs.kraken.com/websockets/#errortypes, but I couldn't cover all those
- Verified this project without Docker implementation is not completed, and possibly I can make it today
